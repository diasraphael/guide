Clear Goal:

should be time measurable ? TODO

should not copy paste the code, understand and start typing

code your ideas

make projects

never become frustrated with the code is not efficient and clean

share it and explain others so it will stick in your head

dont just watch tutorials. do code.

### Whenever we encounters a problem

He jumps at the problem- without much thinking
He implements his solution in an unstructured way
he gets stressed out when things dont work
He is too proud to research solutions

### FIX

stay calm and slow down, dont just jump at a problem without a plan
Take a very logical and rational approach(programming is just a logic in the end)

### 4 step framework to solve this problem

1. understand the 100% of the problem
   ask the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem.

2. Divide and conquer
   break a big problem into smaller problems

3. Dont afraid to do as much research as you have to

4. for bigger problems write pseudo code before writing the actual code
