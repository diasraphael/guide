## Azure virtual machine

- a server where we can host our application IAAS
- region - where we wanted to have our server, close to users
- availability - server reboot or patch update can make the server go down
- each region can have 3-4 data center or/ availability zones
- public inbound ports - open http,https for web access, rdp for desktop login
- stopping the vm will release the ip address of the machine as well
- Azure resource manager - ARM templates - when we create vm dont click on the create instead, download for arm templates
- we can also add it library so u can use it later from library to create vm
