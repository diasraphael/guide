# Cloud Computing

Ability to rent computing resources on demand.

computing resources:

- windows servers
- unlimited file storage
- database
- message queues
- content delivery network
- batch processing jobs

1. Cloud concepts

2. Azure architecture and services

3. Azure management and governance

Public cloud

Delivered via the public internet

Shared by many organisations

Private cloud

Dedicated on premises hardware

Used exclusively by single organisation

Delivered to specific group of people

Hybrid

Combines private and public cloud

Vpn or dedicated connection(Aws direct connect)

Cloud service types

IAAS

I retain the complete control

I pay for the resources I use

Not paying for when I am not using it

Whole bunch of responsibility

They provide the

hardware

Storage

Network

Compute

Pay as you go

(virtual machines, networking, load balancer, firewalls)

Aws EC2, compute engine GCP

PAAS

Elastic beanstalk AWS

I have Application code and use this and run

Complete development and deployment environment in the cloud

Upload code packages and have then run without access to cloud

They take care of the os, availability

Saas

Consuming a software as service

Allows access to use cloud based apps

Access to configuration only

Eg dropbox

Ms word 365

Serverless

No need to care about scaling

Means you don’t want to pay if you don’t use the service

Azure offers

Compute azure functions

Compute serverless kubernetes

Azure sql database serverless

Cosmos db serverless

EC2 - unmanaged instances

Services offered by aws

Lambda - lambda is tiggered and a piece of code is executed

2. Benefits of cloud computing

Cost savings

Auto scaling

High availability : amount of the time the system is operational

Elasticity: ability of the system to grow and shrink automatically

Reliability

Predicatability

Security

Governance,

Monitoring-check applications are safe

Eu -gdpr-related to data

Cloud pricing

Difficult to predict your monthly bill

Difficult to understand In advance

Possibility for big savings but you loose predictability

Factors affecting VM pricing

Geographical region

Instance size

Bandwidth

Savings plan

Operating system

Disk type

### Storage

55 free services in Azure

Usually you pay for data storage

.02$ for 1 gb

Pay for operation

Pay per query to the database

1. blob: binary large object
2. in aws its s3
3. in azure azure storage which has common types
4. hot : frequently used
5. cool : not frequently used
6. azcopy is used to copy files from and to azure
   Hypervisor: helps Physical server to be able to create multiple VMs

Virtual servers

ec2 in AWS IAAS

Virtual machine in azure

Compute engine in gcp

### Containers in cloud

Each OS contains a container

Each container will have their own application and their dependency, library, config files

Container will help u create multiple individual application

AWS: ECS- elastic container service

Containers

Usually smaller microservices

AWS elastic kubernetes services

Google: kuberneties

Azure : azure kuberbetes services

Each server can create multiple virtual machine using hypervisor

Each container running in a os can create multiple containerized application within it.

Benefits of container

portable

Fargate:

Takes care of the host, server, compute resources

We will care only about the container and the container image to run our application

### Object vs block storage

Object

Storing images, files, backups

S3 bucket aws

Azure blob azure

Google cloud storage

Static webpage can be used

Html

Script media

Images

Videos

Here we are not using server and going serverless

And here we are using s3 object to serve the html files

Object storage is a data lake

The size of the object can be of any size

Unstructured data

Block storage

Storing volumes

### Cloud Security

Shared responsibility

My responsibility

Information and data

Devices

Accounts, identities

Cloud provider

Physical host, network, datacenter

CDN

Can setup fire wall rules

Can setup load balancer

Request comes through cdn

Aws -- cloudfront

Gcp -- google cdn

### Databases in the cloud

Relational databases

Rdbms: sql, oracle,mysql can be run on an unmanaged virtual server(ec2, compute engine)

We have the control

Managed relational databases (RDS, cloud sql, azure sql)

Will be managed by the cloud provider

Control will be less

Non relational databases

Aws- dynamo db

Gcp: cloud bigtable

Azure: cosmos

With data warehouse it’s a structured data

Large amount historical data

Massively scalable

## Azure Architecture and services

Core architecture components of azure

Cloud Infrastructure

### Regions (60 regions , not all accessible)

Geographic area (US East)

Will have multiple availability zones

Region pairs

Software rollout is done in one region and other region is untouched

If one goes down other takes priority

Sovereign region

### Availability Zones

There are 1 or more data centers

Each availability zone will have different power grid

So we will deploy our application in webserver to different availability zones so that if one fails other will help

### Edge Location

Content will be cached in edge location

So that user can use application faster

Edge location near to user will receive the request

### Resources group

Grouping the vm, db, networking (logical grouping and not physical grouping)

Subscription will be on top of the resource groups

Subcription is for the pricing

Management group will be on top of the subscription

Order

Management Group

Subscription

## Identity & Access & Security

1. identity is representation of a person, application, device
2. Azure provides an identity management system based on their popular active directory
3. azure Ad provides identity as a service. instead of having to write code to handle users, password,password reset.
4. security, reduced development time, easier support,centralised administration
5. when we have many application we can use azure ad as single way of authorising all the application.
6. only one user id and single sign on password(windows password)
7. multi factor authentication: requires multiple level of access(password & limited time access code(sms, email, authenticator))

### Authentication

1. Authentication is a user proving who they are with username and password
2. move away from users authenticated having admin access

### Authorization

Authorisation is ensuring that the user is permitted to perform an action.

### free services

1. resource groups
2. load balancer
3. virtual network
4. azure active directory
5. network security groups
6. free tier web apps

### pay per usage

### azure pricing calculator

### total cost of ownership calculator

### azure cost management : tool to manage the cost and analyze spending over time

### resource tags : way to add metadata to azure resources

### tools for azure goverance and compliance

### Tools for managing and deploying azure resources

1. Azure portal to manage the resources
2. scripting languages power shell, cli(allows to operate on resources)
3. you can create a script which creates vm(as infrastructure as code)
4.

### Azure Arc : to view other resources running in other cloud providers

### ARM azure resources manager

acts as a authentication between cli and the webapp or vm

### ARM templates : we can create the template of the creation of vm or storage as script from azure portal

### azure advisor : advices based on the usage of the resources we use

### azure health service: will update if the region or the environment of the vm is installed is having any issues

## Monitoring

1. we create alerts, metrics
