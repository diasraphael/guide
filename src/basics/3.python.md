## Python

Python is a high level general-purpose programming language. It uses a multi-paradigm approach, meaning it supports procedural, object-oriented, and some functional programming constructs.

### programming language: python

1. set of instruction to the computer
2. but computers understand only 1 and 0
3. we need a translator(compiler or intrepreter) that converts the source code to binary(0,1)
4. compiler executes the whole source code file to a binary file at once.
5. interpreter interprets line by line and executes it before it goes to the next line.
6. python is written in C (cpython which is the interpreter)
7. python code => taken by interpreter(cpython) => converts to byte code(0,1) => taken by cpython VM and executed in the system.
8. code editors: visual studio code
9. IDEs: pycharm,spyder
10. notebooks: jupyter
11. repl.it(without installing anything we can work with python)
12. python creator guido van rossum
13. python3 --version

## Python datatypes

1. int
2. float
3. bool
4. str
5. list
6. dict
7. set
8. tuple
9. we can create custom types
10. none

## methods

1. bin(5) // converts to a binary no
2. int('0b101',2) // converts to a integer no
3. type('hi') // gives str
4. str(100) // converts to string
5. int('100') // converts to integer
6. input('enter your age') // get inputs from the user and inputs will be in string, so be careful so that you take the correct value out of it(convert to integer).

## variables

1. variables should be written in snake_case.
2. iq=190 // this is how variable is defined
3. PI=3.14 // to declare constants
4. a,b,c=1,2,3 // way to assign value to variable

## expression

a piece of code that evaluates to a value

## statement

a single line of code (ie) a=10 // statement

## string

1. we can use ''' ''' to type long text with multiple lines and print it

## list

list slicing ?TODO

sampleList=[a,b,c,d]

b = sampleList[:] # list copying is happening, 2 distinct object with 2 different reference for a and b.

- list have an order - when to use a list
- when the above list copying is done it has 2 different reference
- returns new list each time
- len(a) returns 4
- sampleList.append(5) # adds a new element to the end of sampleList
- insert will add to any index
- extend merges 2 arrays. sampleList.extend([x,z]). sampleList=[a,b,c,d,x,z]
- pop deletes element at the end , as well as any index and returns the element which is deleted
- remove removes the element based on the value in the list sampleList.remove(z) then if we print sampleList will print [a,b,c,d,x]
- clear removes all the element from the list
- print('a' in sampleList) returns true or false # to check if the element exists
- sampleList.sort() sorts the sampleList
- sorted(sampleList) returns the sorted new list and wont modify the sampleList
- sampleList.reverse() reverses the list
- ' '.join(sampleList) => a b c d
- list unpacking:

```
  a,b, *rest = sampleList
  a will have value 'a'
  b will have value 'b'
  rest will have remaining
```

## Dictionary or dict

```
dictionary ={
a: 1,
b: 'a'
}

print(dictionary['a'])
```

- dict dont have an order, when to use an dict
- dict should have a unique key
- print('a' in dictionary.keys()) # to check if key exists
- print(1 in dictionary.values()) # to check if value exists
- print(1 in dictionary.values()) # to check if value exists
- dictionary.items() returns all the values of the dictionary
- dictionary.clear() removes all the values
- dictionary.copy() returns a new object with different reference
- dictionary.update({c: 'abc'}) will update the existing dict

## Tuple

```
myTuple =(1,2,3,4,5)
```

- immutable
- we cannot reassign
- if we dont want to change then use tuple instead of list
- len(myTuple)

## Set

```
my_set={1,2,3}
mew_set={2,3,4}
```

- unordered unique objects
- my_set.add(6) # to add an element
- list(my_set)
- my_set.copy() creates new set with different reference
- my_set.difference(new_set) returns the difference # returns {1}
- my_set.discards(2) discards 2 from my_set
- my_set.intersection(new_set) returns what is common
- my_set.isdisjoint(new_set) returns true if they dont have anything in common
- my_set.union(new_set) returns all the unique minus the common ones
- my_set.issubset(new_set) to find if all items in my_set exist within new_set
- my_set.issuperset(new_set) to find if my_set is superset of new_set

## Ternary operator

```
is_friend = False
can_message = "message allowed" if isFriend else "message not allowed"
print(can_message)
```

## is vs ==

True is True # checks the memory reference
true == true # checks the value

## iterable

iterable is list,set,tuple,string,dict which can be iterated

## range

range returns an object which can be iterable

```
for _ in range(5)
print(_)
prints 0 to 4,\_ acts as a variable

```

## enumerate

´´´
for i,x in enumerate([1,2,3])
print(i,x) # i prints index and x prints value

´´´

## function

´´´
def sayhello(name): # parameter
print(f'hi {name}')

sayhello('Dias') # argument
´´´

## methods vs function

- the above sayhello is a function
- 'abc'.capitalize() is a method

## docstrings

´´´
def sayhello(name):
´´´ display name of the user ´´´ # this the docstring
print(f'hi {name}')

sayhello('Dias')

print(sayhello.**doc**) #prints the docstring
´´´

## \*args vs kwargs

´´´
def sum(\*args):
print(sum(args))

sum(1,2,3,4)
´´´

## Notes

1. formatted strings === format() // used for same purpose prefer print(f"Hi {firstname}")
2. print(array[0:len(array)]) // to retrieve particular values
3. input("") // to get input from user
4. list is similar to array, array.append to add additional value, array.sort to sort the array,array.pop to delete an element
5. set does not allow duplicate values {1,2,4,1}
   print({1,2,4,1}) //will print 124
6. how to create virtual environment
   `python -m venv fastapienv`
   `fastapienv/Scripts/activate.bat`

## Points

1. It can work with any client-side framework, and can deliver content in almost any format (including HTML, RSS feeds, JSON, and XML).

2. Django enables protection against many vulnerabilities by default, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking (see Website security for more details of such attacks).

3. As a result, experienced Python/Django developers typically run Python apps within independent Python virtual environments. This enables multiple different Django environments on a single computer. The Django developer team itself recommends that you use Python virtual environments!

4. Experienced Python developers may install additional tools, such as linters (which help detect common errors in code).

Note that you should use a Django-aware linter such as pylint-django, because some common Python linters (such as pylint) incorrectly report errors in the standard files generated for Django.
