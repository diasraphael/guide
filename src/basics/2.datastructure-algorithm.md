# Algorithm and Data Structures

## Linked list

1. grows dynamically(as opposed to an array)
2. access is O(n)
3. each one has a pointer reference that is an address to the next one
4. inserts at head O(1)
5. inserts at end O(n)

## Doubly linked list

1. each node has a next and previous pointer
2. insert at front or back is O(1)
3. access is still O(n)

## Hashtable

With a nominal complexity of O(1) for inserts, lookups, and deletions, hash tables are hard to beat. It is important however to have a good hash function and a sufficient number of buckets to avoid hash collisions, which could cause the complexity to degenerate to O(n) worst case.

## Binary tree

1. each element has the left and right child
2. if the left and right are ordered, it is a binary search tree
3. access is O(log(n)) on average. O(n) worst case

## Graph

1. consists of nodes that can be connected in arbitrary ways
2. eg friends in a social network, paths in a society, networks in general
3. traversal strategies breadth first search, depth first search
4. access is O(V+E)

## Linear Search

1. start at the beginning and keep going until you find what you are looking for
2. O(n)

## Binary search

1. start with sorted array or list
2. start at the middle and split the array into 2
