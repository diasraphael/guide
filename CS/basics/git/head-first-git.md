Version control allows you to do the same with your workâ€”it gives you a way to save your progress. You can do a little bit of work, save your progress, and continue working.

Git allows you to confidently collaborate with your fellow
developers over the same set of files, without stepping on each others toes.

A Git repository is a folder that is managed by Git.
