## Project planning

1. user stories: Description of the application's functionality from the users perspective. All user stories put together describe the entire application.

2. features: then to visualise the different actions the user can take and how the program should react to these actions.

3. flowchart: we usually put these features into a nice flow chart.flowchart will tell about what we will build.

4. architecture: how we will build it. how we will organise our code and what javascript features we will use.we can do these in many different ways like all code in one single file or we can use separate this into many functions or we can use this using classes or with the mix of these.we need to finalise our approach like which method we will use or it will turn into a unmanageable code.till now its planning

5. development: implementation of our plan using code.

### user stories

1. description of the applications functionality from the users perspective.
2. As a [type of user](who? user, admin), I want [an action](what), so that [benefit](why)
   eg: step1:As a user I want log my running workouts with location,distance,time, pace,steps/minutes, so I can keep a log of all my running  
    step2:As a user I want log my cycling workouts with location,distance,time, pace,steps/minutes, so I can keep a log of all my cycling.
   step3:As a user I want see all my workouts at a glance so i can easily track my progress overtime.
   step4:As a user I want see all my workouts on a map so i can easily check where i work the most.
   step5:As a user I want to see all my workouts when I leave my app and come back later, so that i can keep using the app over the time.
3. you need to think from the users perspective and in the users feet

### features

1. map where user clicks to add new workout(best way to get the coordinates)
2. geolocation to display map at current location
3. a form to input the distance,time, pace, minutes/step
4. to display all workouts in a list.
5. to display all workouts on the map.
6. store workout data in browser using local storage
